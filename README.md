# XPurge

A client-side tool designed to bulk delete X posts based on user-specified keywords, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

The goal of XPurge was to simplify the process of removing multiple X posts without manual effort. Users would input an X API key, provide keywords, and the tool would fetch their posts, identify matches, delete them, and display a count of deleted postsâ€”all from a simple web interface.

## Features (Intended)

1. Input an X API key to fetch username and post count.
2. Add multiple keywords via dynamic textboxes.
3. Confirm and delete posts containing any of the keywords.
4. Display the total number of deleted posts or any errors.

## Setup

- Hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://svnu.me](https://svnu.me)
- Requires only `index.html` and `script.js` (client-side only).

This project was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the X API for post management.
